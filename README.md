Draft for my company's quote program.

Vesion 1:
This will be my first proyect implementing knowledge of HTML and CSS.
The main puropose is to make something I can later use to implement Java Script.

Version 2:
Using Java Script I'll start creating objects with the information the user gives me.
With the information of the packages I'll try to get quotes from my carriers with API requests.

Version 3:
I'll try to store the information and make it only accesible to a user that has logged in.
